# 3D Fractal Mountains

### Vicky McDermott, Emily Lepert, Will Thorbecke

## Project Idea Description
We want to use OpenGL to render art of some kind. We plan to render a mountain using a fractal algorithm. We also want to include mouse and keyboard input of some kind. A possible addition would be to add a sunset to texture the lighting. A stretch goal would be to then print the mountain using a 3D printer. This would involve us generating the 3D printing code.

## Learning Goals
One of our learning goals is to learn C++. We would like to learn about how fractals can be used to generate interesting artistic objects. We want to learn how to use the OpenGL library. We are also interested in learning about the different forms of light and how they can be used to color and illuminate an image.

## Resources and Current Progress
So far, we have been able to generate a pyramid using OpenGL that we are able to rotate around using mouse input. We have also started created a fractal algorithm and are looking into how we can render a height map generated by our algorithm in OpenGL. We are planning on using the Diamond Square algorithm for our fractal algorithm. We found a cool resource that visualizes this algorithm: http://www.paulboxley.com/blog/2011/03/terrain-generation-mark-one. Additionally we are able to render a sphere and change the orientation and incoming direction of light on that sphere. We used this resource to get us started with OpenGL: http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/introduction-opengl-programming?page=0,1. We are using this resource to learn about lighting in OpenGL: http://www.glprogramming.com/red/chapter05.html.
Lastly, we have implemented a TGA library capable of importing TGA files and rending the height map values from the TGA file on screen. We are using this tutorial to help us getting are initial height map rendering capabilities up and running: http://www.lighthouse3d.com/opengl/terrain/index.php?heightmap.

## Next Steps
* Look into creating a 3D printable file from an OpenGL rendering of a shape/object - Vicky
	DOD: we have a 3D printable file from a simple OpenGL shape rendering
* Finish Fractal algorithm - Emily
	Already accomplished: Diamond square algorithm on array of size 5 for relatively flat terrain
	DOD: Create a 2d array of arbitrary size whose numbers reflect the heightmap of a mountain
* Generate OpenGL rendering from fractal algorithm output - Will
	DOD: Call a function from a header file containing Emilyâ€™s fractal generation algorithm and receive a heightmap through which we will use the TGA library to render said heightmap.
* Incorporate lighting and mouse movement of OpenGL objects into fractals code
	DOD: The rendered heightmap contains lighting effects and responds to keyboard and mouse movements
