# 3D Fractal Mountains

### Vicky McDermott, Emily Lepert, Will Thorbecke

## Project Idea Description
We want to use OpenGL to render art of some kind. Our initial idea is to render a mountain using a fractal algorithm. We also want to include mouse and keyboard input of some kind. A possible addition would be to add a sunset to texture the lighting. A stretch goal would be to then print the mountain using a 3D printer. This would involve us generating the 3D printing code.

## Learning Goals
One of our learning goals is to learn C++. We would like to learn about how fractals can be used to generate interesting artistic objects. We also want to learn how to use the OpenGL library.

## Resources

* [OpenGL Tutorial](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/)
* [C++ Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/index.htm)
* [Keyboard and mouse input](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/tutorial-6-keyboard-and-mouse/)

## First Steps

* Render a pyramid in OpenGL - Vicky
DOD: A pyramid is rendered and able to be colored in openGL
* Render a sun with light - Will
DOD: A scene is rendered with a sphere that expels light
* Write/look into fractal algorithm - Emily
DOD: Either a fractal texture implemented in 2D or 3D on a square in OpenGL, or have implemented a tutorial of some kind
